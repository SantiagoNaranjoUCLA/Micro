\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Our brief literature review on Winner-Takes-All contracts in crypto-prediction markets underscores a complex interplay of efficiency, arbitrage opportunities, and susceptibility to manipulation. Theoretically, these markets are designed for high efficiency, which should limit arbitrage, but practical limitations like information delays and liquidity constraints create transient arbitrage scenarios. Moreover, the presence of unlimited share quantities in these markets raises concerns, as smaller markets can be more easily manipulated. This comprehensive view emphasizes the need for a nuanced understanding of market dynamics, balancing theoretical models with real-world market behaviors.
