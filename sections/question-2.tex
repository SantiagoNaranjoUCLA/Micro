\section{General Equilibrium}

There are two goods and \( J \) agents, \( j \in \{1, \ldots, J\} \). Each agent has identical utility \( u(x^j_1, x^j_2) = \sqrt{x^j_1} + \sqrt{x^j_2} \). Agent \( j \) is endowed with \( (\omega^j_1, \omega^j_2) \). We normalize the price of good 2, so the prices of the two goods are \( (p_1, p_2) = (p, 1) \). Denote aggregate endowments by \( \omega_1 = \sum_j \omega^j_1 \) and \( \omega_2 = \sum_j \omega^j_2 \).


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{tcolorbox}
    (a) What is agent \( j \)'s demand, \( x^j_1(p, \omega^j_1, \omega^j_2) \) and \( x^j_2(p, \omega^j_1, \omega^j_2) \)?
\end{tcolorbox}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{tcolorbox}
    (b) Show that agent \( j \)'s indirect utility is \( v(p, x^j_1, x^j_2) = \left[ \frac{1+p}{p} (\omega^j_1 + \omega^j_2) \right]^{1/2} \).
\end{tcolorbox}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{tcolorbox}
    (c) Equating aggregate demand and the aggregate endowments, solve for equilibrium prices.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}
    (d) Show that agent \( j \) is a net seller of good 1 if
    \[
    \frac{\omega^j_1}{\omega^j_2} > \frac{\omega_1}{\omega_2}.
    \]
\end{tcolorbox}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{tcolorbox}
        (e) Suppose an agent \( k \) finds a small amount of good 2, so their endowment \( \omega^k_2 \) rises a little. How does this impact the price \( p \)? Show that agent \( j \)'s utility increases if she is a net seller of good 1.
\end{tcolorbox}
