\section{Predictive Markets}
\label{sec:predictive_markets}
A prediction market, as commonly defined and the focus of this work, is a market where participants can trade and exchange contracts, and the payoffs are contingent on the outcomes of future events(/citeauthor{wolfers2004prediction}). This type of market has caught the attention of the media and various technology companies in recent years due to its ability to make more accurate predictions through its pricing. According to an article from /textcite{Roose_2023}, "Prediction markets offer a better way to search for truth â€” rewarding those who are good at forecasting by allowing them to make money off those who are bad at it, while settling on the facts in an unbiased way".
