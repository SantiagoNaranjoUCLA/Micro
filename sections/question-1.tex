\section{Dynamics of a Demand Shock}

Consider the market for a single good. Market demand is \( X(p) = 1500 - 50p \), where \( p \) is the price of the good. There are many potential firms, each with cost function \( c(q_k) = 100 + q_k^2/4 \).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{tcolorbox}
    (a) Calculate the long-run equilibrium, in which firms are free to enter and exit. How much does each firm produce (\( q^* \))? What is the equilibrium price (\( p^* \))? How many firms enter (\( K^* \))?
\end{tcolorbox}

Each firm \( k \) will produce in their efficient point. This means:

\begin{eqnarray*}
MCG_k(q_k) = AC_k(q_k)
\end{eqnarray*}

From our cost function \( c_k(q_k) \):
\begin{eqnarray*}
MCG_k(q_k) &=& \frac{d}{dq_k} c_k(q_k) = \frac{q_k}{2}\\
AC_k(q_k) &=& \frac{c_k(q_k)}{q_k} = \frac{100}{q_k} + \frac{q_k}{4}\\
\end{eqnarray*}

Solving for the firm \( k \):
