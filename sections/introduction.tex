\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
This project focuses on providing an understanding of how prediction markets operate in the realm of cryptocurrencies. Specifically, it explores the functioning of Winner-Take-All contracts, where the object of interest is the occurrence of an event. Studying prediction markets is relevant as they are a valuable tool for assessing market expectations, and it is theorized that they have the potential to incorporate all available information thanks to the intervention of many agents creating a joint projection. Some of the questions that this paper will focus on answering are: What are predictive markets? How do prediction markets work in the world of cryptocurrencies? How are the markets designed in Polymarket? Which agents are involved? How does the price of a winner-take-all contract reveal the predictions of an event? Are the assumptions about these markets upheld?
This research is based on a qualitative analysis of data collected from major prediction market platforms, with a particular focus on Polymarket. Some of the variables analyzed to answer our key questions include historical data on prices, trading volumes, and contracts to conduct a comprehensive analysis of trends and patterns in these markets.
