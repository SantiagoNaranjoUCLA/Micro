## Working for Retirement
An agent lives for two periods and chooses how much to work and consume each period.

- At time $t = 1$, she has time $T$ that she divides between work y and leisure $l_1 = T − y$ . She is paid wage $w$ for working. She also consumes $x_1$.
- At time $t = 2$, she is retired and enjoys leisure $l_2 = T$. She consumes $x_2$.

The agent enjoys both consumption and leisure. Her lifetime utility is $u(x_1, x_2, l_1, l_2) = \log (x_1l_1) + \beta \log (x_2l_2)$.  
Where $\beta \in (0,1)$ reflects her impatience.

**a. The interest rate is given by $r$, so $1$ dollar at time $t=1$ is worth $(1+r)$ dollars at time $t=2$. Write down the agent's lifetime budget constraint.**

In period $t=1$

$$
wy - px_1 = s_1
$$
 
Where $s_1$ are the savings in the period 1.

In period $t=2$

$$
px_2= (1 + r)s_1 \implies s_1 = \frac{px_2}{1+r}
$$

Substituting in period one constraint:

$$
wy - px_1 = \frac{px_2}{1+r} \implies wy = px_1 + \frac{px_2}{1+r} 
$$

So the budget constraint is

> $$
> wy = px_1 + \frac{px_2}{1+r} 
> $$

**b. Write down the agent's utility maximization problem.**

> $$
> \max_{x_1, x_2, l_1, l_2} u(x_1, x_2, l_1, l_2)\\
> s.t.\\
> wy = px_1 + \frac{px_2}{1+r}\\
> l_1 = T − y\\
> l_2 = T
> $$

**c. Solve for the agent's optimal choices of  $(x_1, x_2, y)$.**

Rewriting the utility function in terms of $(x_1, x_2, y)$:

$$
u(x_1, x_2, y) = \log (x_1(T - y)) + \beta \log (x_2T)\\
u(x_1, x_2, y) = \log (x_1) + \log (T - y) + \beta \log (x_2) + \beta\log (T)
$$

The new problem of optimization is:

$$
\max_{x_1, x_2,y} u(x_1, x_2, y)\\
s.t.\\
wy = px_1 + \frac{px_2}{1+r}\\
$$

Given the rewrite optimization problem, the First Order Condition for the lagrangian is:

$$
\nabla u(x_1, x_2, y) = \lambda \nabla g(x_1, x_2, y)
$$

where $g(x_1, x_2, y) = wy - px_1 - \frac{px_2}{1+r}$.

Calculating the partial derivatives: 

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_1} = \frac{1}{x_1} \quad ; \quad \frac{\partial g}{\partial x_1} = -p
$$

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_2} = \frac{\beta}{x_2} \quad ; \quad \frac{\partial g}{\partial x_2} = -\frac{p}{1+r}\\
$$

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = -\frac{1}{T - y} \quad ; \quad \frac{\partial g}{\partial y} = w\\
$$

Applying the F.O.C.:

$$
\frac{1}{x_1} = -p\lambda \implies -\frac{1}{px_1} = \lambda
$$

$$
\frac{\beta}{x_2} = -\lambda\frac{p}{1+r} \implies -\frac{\beta(1+r)}{px_2} = \lambda
$$

$$
-\frac{1}{T - y} = \lambda w \implies -\frac{1}{w(T - y)} = \lambda
$$

Reducing the system in two equations:

$$
-\frac{1}{px_1} = -\frac{\beta(1+r)}{px_2} \implies x_2 = \beta(1+r)x_1
$$

$$
-\frac{1}{px_1} = -\frac{1}{w(T - y)} \implies  y = T - \frac{px_1}{w}
$$

Substitute in the budget constraint.

$$
wy = px_1 + \frac{px_2}{1+r}
$$

$$
w\left(T - \frac{px_1}{w}\right) = px_1 + \frac{p}{1+r}\beta(1+r)x_1
$$

$$
wT - px_1 = px_1 + p\beta x_1
$$

$$
wT = px_1 + p\beta x_1 + px_1 
$$

$$
wT = px_1(2 + \beta)
$$

So the optimal consumption and time worked are:

>$$
>x_1 = \dfrac{w}{p}\dfrac{T}{(2 + \beta)}
>$$

>$$
>x_2 = T\beta\dfrac{w}{p}\dfrac{(1+r)}{(2 + \beta)}
>$$

>$$
>y = T\left(1 - \dfrac{1}{(2 + \beta)}\right)
>$$

**d. How does an increase in the wage affect their choices? Provide an intuition.**

$$
-\frac{w}{p} = \dfrac{\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}}{\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_1}}
$$

$$
-\frac{w}{p}(1+r) = \dfrac{\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}}{\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_2}}
$$

$$
(1+r) = \dfrac{\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_1}}{\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_2}}
$$

$$
-\frac{w}{p}\dfrac{\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_1}}{\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_2}}= \dfrac{\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}}{\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_2}}
$$

An increase in salary implies that the marginal disutility of labor decreases compared to the utility of consumption, which means that in period 1 she has incentives to work less. However, in period 2 there are also the same incentives to increase consumption, which is not possible if she decides to reduce her work in period 1.

Ultimately, the best decision is to work the same number of hours, as this ensures the optimal trade-off between consumption in period 1 and period 2.


**e. How does an increase in the interest rate affect their choices? Provide an intuition.**

An increase in salary implies that the marginal disutility on labor is reduced in the face of the utility of consuming, so in period 1 she has incentives to work less. However, in period 2 there are also the same incentives to increase consumption, which is not possible if she decides to decrease her work in period 1.

Finally, the best decision is to work the same number of hours, since this ensures the optimal trade-off between consumption in period 1 and period 2.
