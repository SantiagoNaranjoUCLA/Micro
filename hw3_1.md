# Dynamics of a Demand Shock

Consider the market for a single good. Market demand is $X(p) = 1500 - 50p$, where$p$is the price of the good. There are many potential firms, each with cost function $c_k(q_k) = 100 + q_k^2 / 4$.

**(a) Calculate the long-run equilibrium, in which firms are free to enter and exit. How much does each firm produce $(q^*)$? What is the equilibrium price $(p^*)$? How many firms enter $(K^*)$?**

Each firm $k$ will produce in their efficient point. This means:

$$
MCG_k(q_k) = AC_k(q_k)
$$

From our cost function $c_k(q_k)$:

$$
MCG_k(q_k) = \frac{d}{dq_k}c_k(q_k) = \frac{q_k}{2}
$$

$$
AC_k(q_k) = \frac{c_k(q_k)}{q_k} = \frac{100}{q_k} + \frac{q_k}{4}
$$

Solving for the firm $k$:

$$
MCG_k(q_k) = AC_k(q_k)
$$

$$
\frac{q_k}{2} = \frac{100}{q_k} + \frac{q_k}{4}
$$

$$
\frac{q_k^2}{4} = 100
$$

$$
q_k = 20 
$$

> So each firm $k$ is producing $q^* = 20$.

We know that the supply function for the firm $k$ is $p = MGC_k(q_k)$. The price $p$ is:

$$
p = MGC_k(q_k) = MGC_k(20)
$$

$$
p = \frac{q_k}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
$$

> The equilibrium price is $p^* = 10$.

At this price, the demand is:

$$
X(p) = 1500 - 50p\\
X(10) = 1500 - 50(10)\\
X(10) = 1000\\
$$

> So the demand is $X(10) = 1000$.

To fully satisfy the demand, the total amount of firms producing is:

$$
X(10) = \sum_{k = 1}^{K} q_k\\
X(10) = K q_k = 20 K = 1000\\
K = 50
$$

> So a total of $K^* = 50$ entered into this market to satisfy the demand.

**Suppose demand rises. New demand is given by $\hat{X}(p) = 1800 - 50p$.**

**(b) In the very-short run, each firmsâ€™ output is fixed. What is equilibrium price$(p_v)$? How much profit does each firm make $(\pi_v)$?**

In the very short-run there are only $K=50$ producing $q_k=20$ goods each, so the aggregate supply is $Q = 1000$.

At that level of aggregated supply, and given the new aggregated demand:

$$
\hat{X}(p) = 1800 - 50p = 1000
$$

> The new equilibrium price is $p_v = 16$

At that price, the profit of each firm is:

$$
\pi_v = 16(20) - (100 + \frac{20^2}{4})
$$

> So each firm is making a profit of $\pi_k = 120$.
> This level of profit is not sustainable because, as time passes, firms have incentives to produce one extra unit and take advantage of that price.


**(c) In the short run, each firm can adjust its output to maximize its profits, but there is no entry or exit. What is equilibrium price $(p_s)$? How much does each firm produce $(q_s)$? How much profit does each firm make $(\pi_s)$?**

The number of producers remains the same, so $K=50$. Now each firm wants to maximize their profit.

$$
\pi_k(q_k) = pq_k-c_k(q_k)
$$

In order to maximize:

$$
\dfrac{d}{dq_k}\pi_k(q_k) = 0 \implies p - \dfrac{q_k}{2} = 0
$$

$$
q_k = 2p
$$

So the optimal aggregated supply is:

$$
Q(p) = 50(2p) = 100p
$$

In equilibrium $\hat{X}(p) = Q(p)$:

$$
\hat{X}(p) = Q(p)
$$

$$
1800-50p = 100p \implies p_s = 12
$$

At this price, the aggregated demand is:
$$
\hat{X}(p_s) = 1800 - 50p_s = 1800 - 50(12) = 1200
$$

So each firm produces:

$$
q_s = \dfrac{1200}{50} = 24
$$

And makes a profit of:

$$
\pi_s = (12)(24) - 100 - \dfrac{24^2}{4} = 44
$$


> As a summary, in the short-run, the new equilibrium is:
> $$
> K = 50,\\
> q_s = 24,\\
> p_s = 12,\\
> \pi_s = 44\\
> $$

**(d) In the long run, there is free entry and exit. How much does each firm produce $(q_e)$? What is equilibrium price $(p_e)$? How many firms enter $(K_e)$?**

In the long run, assuming that each firm has the same cost function, each firm will produce $q_c = 20$ at a price $p_c = 10$, which is the efficient point identified prior to the expansion of demand. 

To find the quantity of firms producing:

$$
K_c = \dfrac{\hat{X}(p_c)}{q_c} = \dfrac{1800 - 50(10)}{20} = 65
$$

> In the long-run there will be $K_c = 65$ firms producing.
