	This project, led by Mauricio Vargas and Santiago Naranjo, will focus on providing an understanding of how prediction markets operate in the realm of cryptocurrencies. Specifically, we will explore the functioning of Winner-Take-All contracts, where the object of interest is the occurrence of an event.  Prediction markets are a valuable tool for assessing market expectations, and it is theorized that they have the potential to include all available information thanks to the intervention of many agents creating a joint projection. Additionally, we will investigate the interactions between the different agents in the prediction markets, how the predictions are formed, and, finally, we will use examples of contracts in Polymarket to investigate different assumptions about these markets.
