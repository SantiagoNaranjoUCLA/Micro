	This project, led by Mauricio Vargas and Santiago Naranjo, will focus on providing an understanding of how prediction markets operate in the realm of cryptocurrencies. Specifically, we will explore the functioning of Winner-Take-All contracts, where the object of interest is the occurrence of an event. The study of prediction markets is crucial, as they serve as a vital tool for gauging market expectations. It is theorized that they can assimilate all available information effectively through the involvement of numerous agents, thereby forming a collective projection. Throughout this text, we will delve into the interactions among various participants in the prediction markets, explore how predictions are formulated, and use specific examples from Polymarket to examine relevant hypotheses regarding these markets such as their level of efficiency, arbitrage opportunities, and their low susceptibility to manipulation.
	The analysis undertaken in this study encompasses a qualitative examination of key research in the field of Crypto-predictive markets, complemented by a quantitative analysis of data sourced from leading prediction market platforms, with an emphasis on Polymarket. To address the core questions of the study, variables such as historical pricing, trading volumes, and contract details are scrutinized. This approach allows for a thorough investigation into the prevailing trends and behavioral patterns evident in these markets.
