## Home Bias Puzzle
### In class, we showed that investors tend to invest too much in bonds given historical rates of return (the "equity premium puzzle"). Figure 1 shows that investors tend to invest heavily in domestic markets. Do you think this portfolio choice is consistent with utility maximization? If not, what might explain it?

This portfolio allocation diverges from the principles of utility maximization, as it exhibits a pronounced preference for domestic markets. Typically, this approach falls short of optimizing investment returns and, consequently, the overall utility of the investor. Making such a choice often results in missed opportunities for investing abroad and achieving higher profits. If an investor fails to diversify their portfolio with international securities, it may become vulnerable in the event of a significant economic downturn in their home country. Conversely, a well-constructed international portfolio provides significant diversification benefits.

The primary rationale behind this phenomenon is often attributed to what is widely recognized in the realm of investments as "Home Bias," as defined by Investopedia in 2022: "refers to investors' tendency to favor companies from their own country over those from other countries or regions. The tendency to invest in our own backyard is not unusual or surprising; it is a worldwide phenomenon, and certainly not unique to U.S. investors‚Äù. It can be understood as investors being more familiar with and having a positive outlook on their domestic market, partly because of the recognition and value they place on domestic brands.

Furthermore, other contributing factors include regulatory restrictions on foreign investment, additional transaction costs, and currency risks when investing in international markets.

In conclusion, while "Home Bias" and other factors may lead investors to favor domestic markets, this preference often comes at the expense of optimal utility maximization. Diversifying across international markets can provide investors with a more robust, risk-averse, and potentially higher-yielding investment strategy, reducing the vulnerability to economic shocks in their home country.
